# How to update your page

There are **65 students** in this show! I don't have time to manually edit or check peoples' work!

There are two forms you need to complete:

- [Part I form - artist biography](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmHKFauB7llCnYPn-QrxvljPoriIc6hLSJ8gXDKqFV-1J9ow/viewform)
- [Part II form - artwork](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-GsbPCEukeBz0XVYLJrxBMT8Djjyh835389A9gLt8XR9maw/viewform)

The pages are automatically generated from whatever you submit in the forms! If you need to change something then you need to submit the entire form again, copy in anything from before which you want to keep. If you type things like "N/A" then that is what will appear on your page. 

You also need to submit all your images each time! Get the sizes correct or they will look stretched

- Bio image **600x600px**
- Artwork images **1920x1080px**
