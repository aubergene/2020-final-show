Eri Ichikawa is a visual designer whose work engages with abstract images formed by generative art. Drawing on her background in book design and typesetting, her interest is in graphically visualising information from numeric data to abstract messages, both on a network and on paper. Her desire is to make aesthetics equally accessible and useful to more people, regardless of their backgrounds and without any requirements.
