**Tate Smith** is an American visual artist working across a broad variety of mediums. His work interrogates conventions, norms and mores through combative questioning of dominant narratives and the ontological conditions of what art is or what art can be. Smith’s work engages with art history as much as the present in order to tease out an uneasy balance via juxtaposition--what can be said of something old that is still true today? He grew up in a creative family, one parent a director and the other a designer, who nurtured an interest in the art scene from a very young age which informed his whimsical, childlike candor within the contemporary art discourse.
Tate Smith’s studio is based out of Los Angeles. He has had shows in New York, Paris and Tehran and collectors all over the world.
