This work continues the artist's research into family history, memory, and the way digital technology may provide another lens through which to examine prior experiences.

"Lockdown" explores the invisible tensions experienced through the recent months within the setting of the artist's own domestic environment. During this time, day to day experience has blurred into a strange, formless temporality. New rituals have arisen as we adjust to life in domestic confinement. 

This work explores how this confinement may appear from a temporal perspective. Using digital forensic techniques to reconstruct the domestic scene, the artist is observed by time. The spatial motion of the user's body is translated to variations within the temporality of the viewed scene. 

The use of augmented reality reflects how experience mediated through our screens and digital devices has increasingly become the only way to connect to the real world. The presence of a viewer draws the disparate perspectives together, constraining the viewpoint to a single point of view, entangling them into the artist's lockdown experience. 

The work draws inspiration from quantum physicist and philosopher Karen Barad, the methodologies and practice of Forensic Architecture and the cinematography of Alfred Hitchcock.
