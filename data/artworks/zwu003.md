Mimicry is a multi-screen video installation powered by computer algorithms and inspired by mimicry in nature, the unique way of which species protect themselves by changing color and pattern in response to environment.

In this experimental art piece, cameras will be recording plants in real-time, and through a genetic algorithm the color and shape of virtual insects will be generated and evolved over time, toward the ultimate goal of visually blending into the recorded background. This simulated breeding, selection, and mutation are visualized across the video monitors positioned in front of the aforementioned living plants as they progress.

In addition to exploring the intersection between nature and computation, we find that this work has relevance to the human society as well, as Walter Lippmann describes it in his book Public Opinion, people construct a pseudo- environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone’s pseudo-environment is a fiction.

The setup of the installation is an homage to Nam June Paik ’s TV Garden. Paik imagined a future landscape where technology is an integral part of the natural world. We find that perspective compelling even today in 2020.
