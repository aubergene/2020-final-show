This is a project created by the artist's own experience. Is the skin a biological organism or a cultural product? The meaning of skin is not just a piece of skin being confined to beauty and ugliness. Our skin contains vitality that you can't imagine. If you observe it with a microscope, you will find that there are tens of thousands of microorganisms wriggling here. She made a very grotesque device that amplifies and exaggerates the relationship between microbes and skin, to imply the confusion on the physical boundaries between humans and microbes. Find a delicate balance. And she tried to use this project to allow the audience to interact with the device to have a dialogue with the microorganisms to demonstrate the power of the microorganisms.
