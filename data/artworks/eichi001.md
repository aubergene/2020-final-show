Through the Window is an installation that includes visualisation of real-time weather data from over 150,000 cities around the world. 

The abstract living green images projected inside the window frame on a wall changes colour, growing direction and speed depending on weather data from the cities. The city displayed changes every 30 seconds so that viewers can feel as if they are travelling around the world as they look through the window.

The application is made with P5.js and loads current weather data using API. It then converts the numbers related to temperature, humidity, wind speed and angle into visuals.

After experiencing the COVID-19-related lockdown, during which many people were unable to travel, this work aims to invoke a feeling of virtual travel in the viewer. This window lets people sense the weather of somewhere else without physically going there.
