Social dysDance 1 is an interactive dance improvisation which explores relationships in our current liminal space and time. The primary relationship is between the dancer, Shinichi Iova-Koga, and his laptop computer. Using a Kinect depth camera, Shinichi’s improvised movements and shapes are perceived by the computer as data. This collection of numbers is fed back to Shinichi graphically. 

As Shinichi improvises, he acts as both a dancer and a graphic designer. He watches himself dance and sees how the computer interprets what he does. He is both inside and outside the piece, both performer and audience. It’s a selfie with an incomplete self.

The piece created between the two of them shifts and hovers between human and computation, figurative and abstract, flesh and math. The body is at times fully visible and at other times merely a fragment. Together Shinichi and the laptop meet at the intersection of generative computational art and dance, creating an unstable hybrid object. This third object shows traits of both parents, but is also its own entity. The computer / human collaboration points toward a destabilisation of anthropocentrism.
