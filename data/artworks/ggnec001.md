The project's aim is to listen, understand, and become more aware of the dynamic and diverse ecosystem of the Thames river. To explore this a pendulum is placed on a floating surface next to Tower Bridge. Through its natural oscillation, the pendulum collects and records the transformations that occur during Tidal shifts. 
Depending on the position of the moon and other factors - such as man-made artifacts and wind- tidal shifts vary. These transformations become unequal and inconsistent, which shapes what the water encounters. 
The data is then used and sent to three stepper motors activating, with the use of magnets and mechanisms, the movement of two devices: a pendulum and a plate of metal pollutants (sand magnetite) collected and recycled from the beaches of the Thames. Furthermore, the devices will generate visuals and sounds giving a whole new voice and sensorial experience for the Tide!
