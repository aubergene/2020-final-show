This project serves as a previsualization tool for an interactive laser projection and a performer, in order to choreograph movements and light using motion capture. Its purpose is to help choreographers or even audience members visualize an idea by changing parameters that affect the projection and the final performance outcome in real-time. It was inspired initially by the “light sculptures” of the avantgard artist Anthony McCall and the later remakes by Initi who enabled a touch response. In this project, I tried to explore the idea further by creating projections that would involve motion response. Made with Unity.
