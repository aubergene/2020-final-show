## How to approach the House

Viewers are encouraged to encounter the shrine alone, for as long as they wish. They can approach with a question - or an open mind. The reading is for them, whatever it may be. They can look and reflect, or record it on their phones, the machine is agnostic of human behaviour.

After the encounter, please leave a Thing - physical at the machine/shrine, or virtually, using the QR code to visit and add online.
