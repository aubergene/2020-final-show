Before focusing on interaction in art, she was a product designer. Yanyi is interested in creating nature-inspired work through technologies like machine learning and interactive installation. She has exhibited her works in numerous contexts including NY20+, A&amp;SM#4.5 and IIIDAward. Some of her works will also be presented in HCII2020 and BIN Norden2020 Conferences. Yanyi was born in China and lived for a long time. She has been based in London and will reside in Sweden for a while later.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/9/2020 21:25:53","email":"ylu007@gold.ac.uk","title":"Augmented Creativity","videoDocUrl":"https://vimeo.com/432846078","interactiveUrl":"https://augmentedcreativitygallery.wordpress.com/","streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Thing power","Bodies in relation","Memory bank"],"media":["cinema","ML","narrative"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"<p>See more collections in the augmented creativity gallery here:</p>\n","artworkHTML":"<p>This work explores a new process of creativity generation under the guide of Jordanous’s Four PPPPerspectives (2016) and speculates intertwined relationships among multi-contributors in computational creativity.

Then these images are postprocessed as environment-driven interactive moving images by optical flow algorithm.</p>\n<p>In this computational system, it is speculated that humans are inspiring themselves and that all other nonegos are used as bridges and catalysts in a closed loop, to some extent.
