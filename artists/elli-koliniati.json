Its purpose is to help choreographers or even audience members visualize an idea by changing parameters that affect the projection and the final performance outcome in real-time. It was inspired initially by the “light sculptures” of the avantgard artist Anthony McCall and the later remakes by Initi who enabled a touch response. In this project, I tried to explore the idea further by creating projections that would involve motion response. Made with Unity.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-18T10:45:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Artist Q&A : Expanded Terrains","username":"qfan001, gsimm002, ekoli001","themes":"Expanded Terrains","medium":"Live Q&A with artists","desc":"An opportunity to watch demonstrations of our artists' work alongside in-depth insight into their process.
