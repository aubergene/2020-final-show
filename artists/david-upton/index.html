To experience it, log on with your smartphone to www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata , and follow the instructions. The system was designed to accompany a psychogeographer on a walk. Because of COVID restriction this year, many such walks have been solitary, with only a virtual link between the walkers, and 'Walking With Data' is a system intended to provide an intelligent friend, that can re-contextualise and expand your experiences, and challenge your perceptions. Your smart phone will start to talk to you, and offer you access to data. The system downloads Javascript to your phone, which manages the interactions. It seeks data from the web using API requests, and interacts with others who are using the system at the same time. It is intended to broaden our perceptions, especially in areas where these are enigmatic, such as geomagnetism, and also to build social interaction. It uses the Big Five personality scales to assess the likes and dislikes of users, and tries to understand them better. It is very much a 'work in progress', and was first tested out at this year's 4th World Congress of Psychogeography.</p> </div> <div class="svelte-h6sy7k artwork-instructions"><h3 class=svelte-h6sy7k>How to interact</h3> <p>Using your smart phone, log on to www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata, and follow the instructions there.</p> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bd-col-1 bg-col-1 col-7 rounded-link" href=https://www.codedwalls.com/walkingwithdata target=_blank>See the work </a> </div> <br> <div></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k section responsive-video"><div class=container><div class="embed-container svelte-13teyld"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed//J5lQIN-0B0M></iframe></div></div></section> </div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k section bg-col-7 artists-section"><div class="container page-max-width"><div class=content><div class=columns><div class="column is-one-third"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k bio-photo" style=background-image:url(img/bios/dupto001.jpeg)></div> <div class="is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><h2 class="svelte-h6sy7k artist-name">David Upton </h2> <div class=artist-bio><p>David Upton is interested in subtle differences, in conceptual art, and in discovering unseen patterns and inter-relationships.
