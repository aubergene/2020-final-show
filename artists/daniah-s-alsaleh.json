Alsaleh tackles notions\nof the unobtrusive, the ordinary, and the common. By deconstructing and rearranging familiar\nobjects and ideas, she makes the invisible visible, manifesting a space for reflection that prompts new\nperspectives and ways of seeing. Systems shape both subject and methodology, as she maps networks\nand structures from language and social orders. Crossing disciplines, her explorations include traditional\nmediums of painting  combined with generative computational processes.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/15/2020 10:08:05","email":"dalsa002@gold.ac.uk","title":"How Do I Remember `Thee","videoDocUrl":null,"interactiveUrl":null,"streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Thing power","Non-directional travel","Memory bank"],"media":["audio visual","generative"],"numImages":5,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"","artworkHTML":"<p>The installation explores the process and mechanism of memory making in the presence of media influences.
