His artworks intend to explore and navigate a spectrum of dynamic resonance between organisms and machines based on the progression of his interdisciplinary research across biophysics, computation and art. He makes works in various media from painting, installations and performance, to digital and computational expressions.  His practice incorporates a consistant concern for &quot;fluid equilibrium&quot; and concept he conveyes though several media to create an extension of aesthetics: from the perception of visible things with natural organs to the perception of invisible things with the help of computation. His work simulates metaphysical reality to bring the meaning of art into more aspects of this current reality.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/23/2020 21:32:18","email":"yzhan037@gold.ac.uk","title":"All is a transient dream","videoDocUrl":"https://youtu.be/XvWMNImJRxY","interactiveUrl":null,"streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Thing power","Bodies in relation","Multispecies rehearsal"],"media":["interactive","audio visual","performance"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"","artworkHTML":"<p>In Daniel Quinn’s novel ‘Ishmael', an interspecific dialogue unfolds between a jellyfish and a gorilla. The conversation is about the evolution of different species. As a result, the jellyfish reluctantly took the honour of being a pinnacle of the evolutionary process because they proceed strictly on the basis of ‘observation, logic and the scientific method’. These 96 percent water entities mock the omnipresent aggrandisement of human beings as the essence of all creatures. Jellyfish are bio-machines, emotional AI and a multi-layered interconnected conscious web.</p>\n<p>With the help of computation, ‘All is a transient dream’ simulates this temporal-spatial dialogue  between ‘gorilla’ and ‘jellyfish’, physical and virtual, organisms and machines. Hence in this project, performers and an interactive system that materialises itself through the imitation of jellyfish as well as the dancing motion of the performer. This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms and machines through a series of visual effects, free-flowing choreography and special commissioned soundtrack.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T19:40:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":true,"physical":true,"title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.","id":10},{"startTime":"2020-09-18T18:50:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":true,"title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.","id":20},{"startTime":"2020-09-19T13:40:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":true,"title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.","id":30},{"startTime":"2020-09-19T19:30:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":true,"title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.","id":40},{"startTime":"2020-09-20T11:50:00.000Z","duration":6,"livestream":false,"physical":true,"title":"All is a transient dream","username":"yzhan037","themes":"Thing Power, bodies in relation and multispecies rehearsal","medium":"Interactive Audiovisual Performance","desc":"This interactive performance intends to illustrate a dynamic relationship between organisms(performer) and machines(jellyfish) through a series of visual effects, improvised dancing and tailored soundtrack.","id":47},{"startTime":"2020-09-18T13:30:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Spotlight Panel : Can plants and animals make art?","username":"floft002, ylu007, yjun001, yzhan037","themes":"Multispecies Rehearsal, Paracomputing","medium":"Spotlight Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance to learn more about our artists whose works explore multispecies making, and whether plants and animals can be their own artists, performers and musicians.
