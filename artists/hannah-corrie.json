Whilst still firmly rooted in this field, Hannah worked as a theorist in an artistic residency with The Koppel Project (2015) exploring the theme of utopia.

Investigations into the London Transport System revealed that some social groups’ needs are prioritised over others. The work focuses on this preferential bias, specifically examining if it has forced some groups to spend longer inside non places than others and that these places can have an impact on one's perception of time. By presenting these non-places within a virtual reality, the piece aimed to draw attention to spaces that are often forgotten, even whilst within them, as well as the people who inhabit them.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T17:00:00.000Z","duration":10,"livestream":false,"physical":true,"title":"It's just a matter of time","username":"hcorr001","themes":"Non-Directional Travel, Experiential array, Bodies in Relation","medium":"VR","desc":"Navigating through non-descript places, time moves in inconsistent ways.
