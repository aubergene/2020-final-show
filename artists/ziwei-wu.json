This simulated breeding, selection, and mutation are visualized across the video monitors positioned in front of the aforementioned living plants as they progress.\nIn addition to exploring the intersection between nature and computation, we find that this work has relevance to the human society as well, as Walter Lippmann describes it in his book Public Opinion, people construct a pseudo- environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone’s pseudo-environment is a fiction.\nThe setup of the installation is an homage to Nam June Paik ’s TV Garden. Paik imagined a future landscape where technology is an integral part of the natural world. We find that perspective compelling even today in 2020.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-19T12:00:00.000Z","duration":45,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Spotlight Panel : How do we create artistic realities with new technologies?","username":"zwu003,vjuss001,rasto001,hcorr001","themes":"Expanded Terrains,Distance Orchestra","medium":"Discussion Panel","desc":"This panel is an opportunity to learn more about our artists whose works explore the use of hot-topic technologies such as machine learning and virtual reality to create artistic realities and interactive digital worlds.
