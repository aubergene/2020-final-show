Using a Kinect depth camera, Shinichi’s improvised movements and shapes are perceived by the computer as data. This collection of numbers is fed back to Shinichi graphically.</p> <p>As Shinichi improvises, he acts as both a dancer and a graphic designer.

It’s a selfie with an incomplete self.</p> <p>The piece created between the two of them shifts and hovers between human and computation, figurative and abstract, flesh and math. The body is at times fully visible and at other times merely a fragment. Together Shinichi and the laptop meet at the intersection of generative computational art and dance, creating an unstable hybrid object.
