You're invited to enter the space with the provided game console and mouse/keyboard, which have effectively become the extensions of our physical apparatus to routinely interact with the digital realm.  The environment is built in Unity and the sound is interactive through communications with Max/Msp. Instead of experiencing music in a fixed time frame, the spatial exploration allows you to disrupt the linear nature of the object identified as a “soundtrack” and re-create the structure of a sound piece. You start bringing out different sonic elements as you travel through the paths at your own pace. In the meantime, you may be transported to an alternative version of the space.  Using the game platform is a medium from which we often seek alternative experience than the present, Liminal Dream is an exploration of the concept of <strong>liminal space</strong>, where our brain temporarily ceased to be able to grasp the entire context while encountered with familiar sense input.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-19T15:00:00.000Z","duration":60,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Discussion Panel : Do we need the Tate and the White Cube when we have Instagram and Animal Crossing?","username":"yjin004,yliao001,tsmit003,cchap005","themes":"Memory Bank, Experiential Array,Expanded Terrains","medium":"Discussion Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance for discussion around how digital technology is shaping where artwork is shown and how it is made, from changes in location to acessibility to all. *Moderated by artist and researcher Teodora Fartan*.","id":67}]}
