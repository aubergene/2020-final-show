Looking at the way we figure sound and music into hierarchies and transforming these into an embodied full body experience.</p> <p>The piece reflects on the space between, filling these empty voids with the richness of organic sound. Thinking about Karen Barad's ideas of materiality and the constructed borders of matter and phenomena. Transferring the energy of the point or planet to the space between, bringing life to what was once empty. Using AR in this way moves the viewer from a static position where the universe unfolds around them, to one where it is produced through their interactions, both known and unknown.</p> <p>The sounds are from a recorded session of improvised singing done in collaboration with Izzy Nahkla. She is a long time friend and on the day we were both quite anxious about the world and life. From this moment we produced this selection of sounds, forming this mournful choral and with it a space to reflect through exploration. Creating space and time outside of our own, looking back to build up and grow.</p> </div> <div class="svelte-h6sy7k artwork-instructions"><h3 class=svelte-h6sy7k>How to interact</h3> <p>Download on an AR capable device here: ios: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1529811825 android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Lorn.SoundSpace.Four&hl=en_GB</p> </div> <br> <div></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k section responsive-video"><div class=container><div class="embed-container svelte-13teyld"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed//bRlox-qyZBc></iframe></div></div></section> <section class="bg-col-2 col-6 section"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k container see-more"><h2 class=svelte-h6sy7k>Want to see more?</h2> <div class=columns><div class=column><p>LIVE ONLINE</p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k><li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#52 style=color:#fff>Artist Q&A : Expanded Terrains</a> - Friday 18 Sep 11.45 </ul></div> <div class="column is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div></div> <div class=column><p>ON SITE</p> <p>Goldsmiths, University of London <br> St James Hatcham Building </p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k></ul></div></div></div> <div class=columns><div class="column is-hidden-mobile"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div> <div class=column><div><a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../getting-there>Getting There </a> </div></div></div></div></section></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 section artists-section"><div class="container page-max-width"><div class=content><div class=columns><div class="column is-one-third"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k bio-photo" style=background-image:url(img/bios/gsimm002.jpeg)></div> <div class="is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><h2 class="svelte-h6sy7k artist-name">George Simms </h2> <div class=artist-bio><p>George Simms is a London based digital artist who makes tools and experiences using cutting edge technology to speculate on and explore our phenomenological experiences.
